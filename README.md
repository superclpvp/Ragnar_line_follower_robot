Ragnar is a line-following robot created by the team Pequenos Cientistas Ragnar.

This robot aims to participate in a competition called OBR (Brazilian Robotics Olympiad). It has to follow a path full of obstacles, gaps, green squares, etc.

The V1 of the robot has:

1 TCA9548A multiplexer
2 DC motors
1 on/off switch
3 Ultrasonic sensors
2 TCS3472 or TCS34725 color sensors - in the electronic schematic, the more common model TCS34725 is used instead of TCS3472
3 Infrared sensors Tcrt5000 Lm393 c
1 MPU6050 gyroscope sensor
1 L293D motor shield for Arduino Uno
1 12V LiPo battery
1 12V to 5V voltage regulator

Note that some components may change during the project's development.
